Pentester and security engineer. I build security that works in production, not just in reports.  
In short: I like **building**, but I often **break things** first so we can build them right.

## Positioning
I operate at **Senior-level scope** in InfoSec and often work as a one-person security team: research, testing, automation, and end-to-end security improvements.

My differentiator: strong autonomy and healthy paranoia.  
Paranoia is useful when it consistently reduces risk.

---

## What I do
- **Pentesting / Bug Bounty:** web, desktop apps (macOS, etc.), real-world attack paths
- **Security tooling:** utilities and plugins for system and web security
- **Security-by-design:** bake security into architecture, not just post-release patching
- **Product security mindset:** security should accelerate delivery via automation

---

## Current focus (2026)
- Building an **anonymous messenger** (engineering + security)
- Applying **OWASP** and **ISO** practices where impact is measurable
- Automating verification to reduce manual drift and improve consistency

---

## Tech stack
- **OS / Infra:** Linux (incl. Kali), Windows, Cloudflare
- **Languages:** Python, PowerShell, TypeScript, Swift
- **Workflow:** AI-assisted implementation as a speed multiplier; validation and ownership stay with me

---

## Tooling
- Burp Suite
- Wireshark
- Kali/Linux security tooling

---

## How I work
- Start from a **real attack scenario**, then choose the highest-impact control
- Iterate fast: **POC -> fix -> recurrence prevention**
- Optimize for measurable risk reduction, not checkbox compliance
- Operate solo effectively and design outcomes that scale for teams

---

## Proven impact
In a production product, I identified and stopped a data exposure affecting around **70k users** and approximately **1.5M documents/forms**.  
Outcome: the attack path was closed, recurrence risk reduced, and process hardening implemented.

---

## Open source / visibility
Public repos are limited by design. Several projects remain private due to infrastructure/security sensitivity.  
For capability walkthroughs, contact via hub.

---

## Learning & practice
- Active **CTF** participant
- Self-directed learning from writeups, articles, and practical labs
- Hands-on method: model risk -> find weaknesses -> fix -> document

---

## Outside of work
Music, video editing, and language learning. Transferable strengths: discipline and attention to detail.

### For teams / clients
I’m interested in work where we can:
- increase security without slowing delivery,
- automate security in CI/CD,
- reduce risk substantively, not cosmetically.
